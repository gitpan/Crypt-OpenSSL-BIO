						    OpenSSL BIO	
			   			   -------------

OpenSSL BIO is a collection of Perl modules that make use of the 
openssl libraries to perform encryption and digesting. There are 4 
modes available to most encryption types. They are: CBC, ECB, CFB 
and OFB. A separate module is provided for each of these modes. 
Digests available are: MD2, MDC2, MD5, SHA and SHA1. 

This is VERY Alpha code. There are no known core dumps but some weird 
quirks seems to exist in special cases. There are some tests for known 
problems so if the tests pass, most basic functions should work. The 
tests are no where near complete yet.

Please read the TODO and BUGS files as this version is undergoing 
significant changes to the code. Adding a lot more/better error 
checking to prevent core dumps and such.

Currently some of the tests may not work, but everything should still 
compile, make and install.



PREREQUISITES

These modules have only been tested with Perl 5.6.1 on Mandrake 
8.1 using openssl 0.9.6c. They require no other Perl modules 
to function.


INSTALLATION

You install these just like any other Perl modules:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


DOCUMENTATION

POD style documentation is included in all modules and scripts.  These
are normally converted to manual pages and installed as part of the
"make install" process.  You should also be able to use the 'perldoc'
utility to extract and read documentation from the module files
directly.

You can also refer to the openssl man pages: BIO_ctrl, BIO_f_base64, 
BIO_f_buffer, BIO_f_cipher, BIO_find_type, BIO_f_md, BIO_f_null, 
BIO_new, BIO_push, BIO_read, BIO_s_accept, BIO_s_connect, BIO_s_fd, 
BIO_s_file, BIO_should_retry, BIO_s_mem, BIO_s_null and BIO_s_socket.
