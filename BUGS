  Encryption/Decryption for ECB and CBC modes is currently broken due 
  to a change in the read and write functions.

  CFB and OFB modes *should* work, but have not been fully tested yet.

  Basically it was all working at a basic level but no error checking 
  existed. Adding error checking broke a lot of it but it will all 
  get worked out.

  This also means that a lot of the tests will fail.
